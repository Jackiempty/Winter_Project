# Readme
This is a ML project of Prof.Chen for undergraduates  
It contains a model to train CIFAR dataset  
Few functions contained:  
* save image from cifar100
* a VGG16 model
* a torch summary of the model
* acc/loss curve plotting

## Current issue
I found out that the server in the lab has four gtx1080 ti  
and I haven't learn how to train with multi-gpus  
maybe the next version will acheive it
